Vermicompost can be applied in many different ways depending on where you're applying it and what type of plant you're applying it to. In this post we show you how to apply vermicompost in:

1. Potted Plants
2. Garden Beds with Plants
3. Unplanted Garden Beds

## Potted Plants

Applying vermicompost to potted plants is easy. The most important thing to remember is not damaging the roots of the plants. Damaged roots negatively affect plant growth and can cancel out the positives effects of vermicompost. 

- Remove top layer of soil to expose just the very upper layer of the roots, taking care not to damage them.
- Spread a layer of vermicompost a couple inches deep. This is about a handful depending on the size of the pot.
- Cover the vermicompost with the removed soil and then water thoroughly.

## Garden Beds with Plants

Vermicompost is most easily applied as a top dressing when being used in garden beds. The key take home message is to use mulch, soil or soil mix to cover your vermicompost to protect it from the sun. 

- Use  the [vermicompost calculator](bit.ly.com/compostcalculator) to find out how much you need to use.
- Spread the vermicompost evenly around the base of each plant in the bed. Start at the base of the stem and then outwards until the area where the outermost leaves cover. 
- Cover the vermicompost with soil, soil mix or mulch then water thoroughly.

## Unplanted Garden Beds

Virtually identical as for the application to beds with plants, when applying vermicompost to unplanted garden beds, it makes sense to apply over as much of the bed as possible. This should be done to spread beneficial microbes to the soil. 

- Use  the [vermicompost calculator](bit.ly.com/compostcalculator) to find out how much you need to use.
- Spread the vermicompost evenly across the surface of the bed. 
- Cover the vermicompost with soil, soil mix or mulch then water thoroughly.
