Vermicompost is a rich product produced through the decomposition of organic matter, such as fruits/vegetables and garden waste, through the action of earthworms and microbes. 

Our product is made by first composting a mixture of browns (e.g. cardboard, hay and/or woodchips) and greens (e.g. vegetable waste, grass clippings, sargassum seaweed) then this composted material is fed to our earth worms who convert it to vermicompost. Our earthworms do this through consuming the organic matter and microbes in the compost then passing this material as castings (earthworm poop). These castings are teeming with beneficial bacteria which help to improve the health of the soil. 

The motion of the worms through the organic matter also helps to introduce oxygen which helps to enhance the breakdown process resulting in the formation of [Plant Growth Hormones (PGF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_hormone#Auxins) which enhance plant and fruit growth. Vermicompost is also naturally rich in organic matter including [humates](https://www.soilbiotics.com/files/7373-soilbiotics-humicacid.pdf), components which are important for soil health.
