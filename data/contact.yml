    title : "About Us"
    content : "What started as a series of happy mistakes evolved into a hobby, and from there, Conuco Worm Farm was formed. 
    
    Founded by Akono and Bryan in Nov. 2020, Conuco Worm Farm aims to bring natural fertility back to your garden. 
    
    To do this we raise our worms on locally available materials to produce 'black gold' or vermicompost, vermicompost extracts and teas.
    
    The name 'Conuco' is an homage to the native Tainos, one of the original inhabitants of the Caribbean. They used their /conucos,/ or small mounds of fertile land to grow foods such as /papaya/ (pawpaw) and /yuca/ (cassava) using natural means. We hope that you too are able to experience all that vermicompost has to offer."
